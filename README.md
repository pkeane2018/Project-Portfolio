# Project-Portfolio

This is the professional site for me, Patrick Keane, to my showcase technical skills and web development projects. It consists of four sections - 'Home', 'About', 'Portfolio', and 'Contact'. 'Home' consists of my headshot, and a short professional headline. 'About' contains information about my past experience, abilities, and the type of work I am currently looking for, ask well as links to my LinkedIn profile and resume. 'Portfolio' contains a list of past projects I've worked on, organized by the language, frameworks, or other tools used to create them. Hovering over the screenshot for each project will give the name of the project, as well as information on the tools used to create it. Clicking on the screenshot will direct the user to another page with more information on that project, along with other screenshots of the working site. The bottom of the homepage contains the 'Contact' section which lists my email address and phone number. There is a menu on the homepage and, all subpages for individual projects, with the sections of the homepage listed. Clicking on any of these section names will direct the user to that section of the homepage.
